/// gas price 0----------------->
However, the gas price isn't provided here, so let's assume it's given or that you're using the current gas price. Here's the calculation formula:

Gas Used (in units of gas) × Gas Price (in wei) = Cost (in wei)
Since you haven't provided the gas price, I'll outline the calculations based on the formulas:

Transaction Cost (in wei) = Transaction Cost (in gas) × Gas Price (in wei)
Execution Cost (in wei) = Execution Cost (in gas) × Gas Price (in wei)


gas price  (_) --------------------->>


Gas Price: The gas price is typically measured in gwei (1 gwei = 10^9 wei), but for calculations, we convert everything to wei (1 ether = 10^18 wei).

Calculation Formula:

Cost in wei = Gas Used × Gas Price
Cost in Ether = Cost in wei / 10^18
